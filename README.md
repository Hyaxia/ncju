ncdu (NCurses Disk Usage) is a disk utility for Unix systems. Its name refers to its similar purpose to the du utility, but ncdu uses a text-based user interface under the [n]curses programming library.
```

ncju, short for NCurses Json Usage, is a file utility for Unix systems.
Its purpose is to do that ncdu does for disks, but for json files.
Basically map all key-value paris and show how much memory each one takes.
